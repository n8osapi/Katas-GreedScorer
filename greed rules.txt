Greed is a dice game where you roll five dice to accumulate
points.  The following "score" function will be used calculate the
score of a single roll of the dice.
 
 * A greed roll is scored as follows:
 * A set of three ones is 1000 points
 * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the
   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).
 * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
 * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.
 * Everything else is worth 0 points.  

 Examples:

 score([1,1,1,5,1]) => 1150 points
 score([2,3,4,6,2]) => 0 points
 score([3,4,5,3,3]) => 350 points
 score([1,5,1,2,4]) => 250 points

 Your task is to write the score method.
 Where you go from there, is entirely up to you.
